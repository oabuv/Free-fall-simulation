# FreeFallSimulation
This is a school project, which is the simple simulation of free-fall body motion simulation using Matlab to achieve insights about the changes of velocity, acceleration, and distance of a falling body.  
You can read through my report uploaded to this repository for more in-depth explanations of how I generated the simulation.
